### Content Extraction from `OWL 01 Intro`

#### Introduction to OWL
* Armin introduces the OWL technical training.
* OWL is Odoo's proprietary JavaScript framework.
* Using OWL, you can change things on the front-end, specifically the client's browser.

#### Why Learn OWL?
* You might have previously taken partner training focused on the back-end framework, which is Python.
* While a lot can be achieved with Python, there are instances where changes need to be made from the JavaScript side.
* For example, the barcode app is entirely implemented on the front-end, allowing users to do a lot on their tablets and browsers before communicating with the server. This is different from standard apps like sales orders or invoices.
* Other apps, like Point of Sale (PoS), can also be used on kiosks or offline.
* To change or implement apps like these, you need to learn OWL.

#### Prerequisites
* General programming skills are helpful.
* Knowledge of JavaScript is also very helpful.
* You should know how Odoo works, both functionally and on the back-end.
* It's recommended to take the back-end training (normal technical training) before this course.
* It's important not to segregate Odoo development into front-end and back-end categories. If you don't understand how Odoo works on the back-end (ORM and server communication), it will be difficult to develop front-end apps.

#### Front-end Structure of Odoo
* At the heart of it all is the web client, which is the framework and code that allows us to render views.
* Back-end view code (e.g., form, tree, Kanban views with special syntax) is sent to the web client, which is in charge of displaying it to the user.
* There's also the core of the web framework, providing many functions and low-level access to utilize various things on the browser side.
* On top of all that, we have OWL, which is basically a component system.

#### Division of Responsibilities
* The web client is responsible for showing the navigation bar, user menu, and executing various actions.
* The JS framework has generic components, some views, and can display fields to the user.
* OWL is a component system that allows you to compose various components and display them to the user or run necessary actions.
* The components we define are primarily part of OWL.
* There's a lot of old, legacy code in Odoo's codebase that is being ported to OWL with every major version. Learning this old code isn't as valuable as it will be deprecated over time.
* OWL is the future and the perfect place to start your JavaScript journey.

#### Types of Odoo Front-end Applications
* In Odoo, there are two types of applications on the front-end.
* One part of Odoo is server-side rendered, like the website and portal (e.g., the webshop where users buy things).
* The other part is the back-end used by internal users, such as the dashboard switcher to switch between different apps. This is a single-page application.
* Examples of single-page applications include PoS and the barcode app.

### OWL Tutorial for Odoo 17: Introduction to Front-End Development


**Description:** This tutorial will introduce you to OWL, Odoo's proprietary JavaScript framework, and explain why it's essential for front-end development in Odoo 17.

#### Step 1: Understanding OWL's Role in Odoo 17

1.  **What is OWL?**
    * OWL is Odoo's proprietary JavaScript framework used for developing and modifying Odoo application front-ends.
    * It enables direct changes in the client's browser.

2.  **Why is OWL Important for Odoo 17?**
    * While much can be achieved with back-end (Python) development, there are scenarios requiring JavaScript-side modifications.
    * Modern applications like PoS and the barcode app are entirely front-end implemented using technologies like OWL, allowing for offline functionality and better performance without constant server communication.

#### Step 2: Ensuring Development Prerequisites

1.  **General Programming Basics:** Ensure you have a fundamental understanding of programming concepts.
2.  **JavaScript Knowledge:** Familiarity with JavaScript will greatly assist in understanding and implementing OWL.
3.  **Odoo Understanding (Functional & Back-end):**
    * It's crucial to understand how Odoo works functionally.
    * It's highly recommended to complete the Odoo back-end technical training first.
    * Understanding Odoo's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) and server communication from the back-end is vital for effective front-end development. Do not strictly separate front-end and back-end development, as they are interconnected.

#### Step 3: Exploring Odoo's Front-end Structure with OWL

1.  **Web Client (Core):**
    * Serves as the heart of Odoo's front-end, responsible for rendering Odoo views.
    * It processes back-end view code (e.g., XML for form, tree, or Kanban views) and displays it to the user.

2.  **Web Framework (Core JS Framework):**
    * Provides fundamental functions and low-level access for browser manipulation.
    * It includes generic components and reusable views.

3.  **OWL (Component System):**
    * Built on top of the web client and JS framework.
    * OWL is Odoo's modern component system, enabling developers to build complex user interfaces by composing smaller components.
    * Most new component development in Odoo currently focuses on OWL. While legacy code exists, OWL is the future and the ideal starting point for your Odoo JavaScript development journey.

#### Step 4: Differentiating Odoo Front-end Application Types

1.  **Server-Side Rendered Applications:**
    * Examples: Odoo Website and Portal.
    * Views are generated on the server side before being sent to the client's browser.

2.  **Single-Page Applications (SPAs):**
    * Examples: Odoo back-end (internal UI), PoS application, and barcode application.
    * Most or all of the application is loaded on a single web page, and content is dynamically updated via JavaScript without requiring full page reloads.

By understanding these fundamentals, you'll be ready to delve deeper into Odoo 17 front-end development using OWL.
