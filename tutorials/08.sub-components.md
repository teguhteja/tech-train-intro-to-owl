### Extracted Content from `OWL 08 Sub-components`

#### Introduction to Sub-components
* This section delves deeper into the concept of composition in object-oriented programming within OWL, specifically how to use one component inside another to create new ones.
* OWL is structured as a tree of components, with a root node that can have children, and those children can also have their own children. This tree structure is how developers should think about structuring their components.

#### Communication Between Components
* Communication between parent and child components is primarily achieved through **props**.
* Props are key-value pairs passed from a parent component to a child component.
* In the child component, `this.props` returns the props passed to it. In the template, `props` can be used as a shorthand.
* **Props in Odoo:** You can define types for props, making them a primary communication mechanism in parent-child hierarchies.
* **Child-to-Parent Communication:** A child component can also communicate with its parent by passing a callback function through props.

#### Hands-on: Creating and Using Sub-components

1.  **Creating a Child Component:**
    * Create a new directory (e.g., `child`) within your `static/src/js/components` directory.
    * Inside `child`, create `child.js` (for JavaScript logic) and `child.xml` (for the template).
    * The `child.js` will define a component, extending `Component`, and will have a template. It **will not** be registered as a view widget directly, as it's meant to be used by the parent.
    * The `child.xml` will use `t-out="props.title"` to display a `title` prop passed from its parent.
    * The child component's template name should follow a convention like `mymodule.child`.
    * **Defining Props for Child:** Add `static props = { title: String };` to the child component's JavaScript to define that it expects a `title` prop of type `String`. Defining types for props is optional but recommended for clarity and debugging.

2.  **Using the Child Component in the Parent:**
    * In the parent component's JavaScript file (e.g., `example.js`), import the child component: `import { Child } from "./child/child";`.
    * Add the imported child component to the parent component's `static components` property: `static components = { Child };`. This makes the `Child` component available within the parent's template.
    * In the parent component's XML template (e.g., `example.xml`), use the child component like a custom HTML tag, passing the `title` prop: `<Child title="'child of example'"/>`.
        * **Important:** When passing string literals as props in XML, they must be enclosed in single quotes within the double quotes of the attribute, because the value is evaluated as JavaScript.
    * **Troubleshooting Compilation Error:** If you get a template compilation error (e.g., `Failed to compile template`), it might be due to incorrect prop passing syntax in the XML. The value for a prop needs to be a valid JavaScript expression.

#### Verification
* After making changes, ensure your Odoo server is updated (e.g., using `python odoo-bin -u my_module`).
* Refresh the Odoo backend view where your parent component is displayed. The text passed via the `title` prop from the parent should now be visible within the child component.

### Odoo 17 Tutorial: Working with Sub-components and Props

**Description:** This tutorial will guide you through creating and using sub-components in Odoo 17 with OWL, focusing on how data is passed between parent and child components using props.

#### Step 1: Create Your Child Component

1.  **Create Directory and Files:**
    * Inside your custom Odoo module's `static/src` directory (e.g., `my_module/static/src`), create a `components` directory if it doesn't exist.
    * Within the `components` directory, create a new folder for your child component (e.g., `child_component`).
    * Inside `child_component`, create two files: `child_component.js` and `child_component.xml`.
2.  **Define Child Component in `child_component.js`:**
    * Import `Component` from `@odoo/owl` and `xml` from `@odoo/owl/core/utils`.
    * Define your child component class, extending `Component`.
    * **Define Props:** Crucially, define the `static props` for your child component. For instance, to accept a `title` string:
        ```javascript
        /** @odoo-module */
        import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";

        export class ChildComponent extends Component {
            static template = "my_module.child_component"; // Link to XML template
            static props = {
                title: String, // Expects a 'title' prop of type String
            };
        }
        ```
    * **Important:** This child component will *not* be directly registered as a view widget. It's meant to be composed within other components.
3.  **Define Child Component Template in `child_component.xml`:**
    * Create a basic template that displays the `title` prop. Remember the `t-name` attribute should match the `static template` property in your JS file:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <templates xml:space="preserve">
            <t t-name="my_module.child_component">
                <div>
                    <h3>Child Component: <t t-out="props.title"/></h3>
                </div>
            </t>
        </templates>
        ```

#### Step 2: Integrate Child Component into Your Parent Component

1.  **Open Parent Component's JavaScript File:** Navigate to the JavaScript file of your existing parent component (e.g., `my_module/static/src/js/example_component.js`).
2.  **Import Child Component:** At the top of your parent component's JS file, import your newly created child component:
    ```javascript
    /** @odoo-module */
    import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";
    import { registry } from "@web/core/registry";
    // Import your child component
    import { ChildComponent } from "./components/child_component"; // Adjust path as needed

    export class ExampleComponent extends Component {
        static template = "my_module.example_component";
        static components = {
            ChildComponent, // Register the child component here
        };
        // ... rest of your parent component code
    }

    registry.category("action_widgets").add("example_widget", {
        Component: ExampleComponent,
    });
    ```
    * **Note:** The `static components` property is crucial for making the child component available within the parent's template.
3.  **Use Child Component in Parent's XML Template:**
    * Open your parent component's XML template (e.g., `my_module/static/src/xml/example_component.xml`).
    * Insert your child component using its class name as a tag, and pass the `title` prop. Remember that string literals for props in XML must be enclosed in single quotes within double quotes because they are evaluated as JavaScript expressions.
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <templates xml:space="preserve">
            <t t-name="my_module.example_component">
                <div>
                    <h1>Hello OWL!</h1>
                    <button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
                    <hr/>
                    <ChildComponent title="'This is from the Parent!'"/>
                </div>
            </t>
        </templates>
        ```

#### Step 3: Update Module Manifest and Restart Odoo

1.  **Update `__manifest__.py`:** Ensure your new `child_component.js` and `child_component.xml` files are correctly included in the `assets` section of your module's `__manifest__.py`. If you're using a wildcard for your `static` directory, they should be automatically included.
    * **Example (if not using wildcard):**
        ```python
        'assets': {
            'web.assets_backend': [
                'my_module/static/src/js/example_component.js',
                'my_module/static/src/js/components/child_component/child_component.js', # New
                'my_module/static/src/xml/example_component.xml',
                'my_module/static/src/xml/components/child_component/child_component.xml', # New
            ],
        },
        ```
2.  **Restart Odoo Server:** Restart your Odoo instance, ensuring your module is updated. Use the `-u` flag for your module (e.g., `python odoo-bin -d YourDatabase -u my_module --addons-path=... --dev=all`).

#### Step 4: Verify Component Composition

1.  **Check in Odoo:** Navigate to the Odoo backend view where your parent component is embedded.
2.  **Observe Output:** You should now see your parent component's content, and within it, the content rendered by your `ChildComponent`, displaying the text "Child Component: This is from the Parent!".

This confirms that your parent component successfully passed data to its child component via props, and the child component rendered that data.
