#### Setting Up the Development Environment
* This section covers setting up a development environment from scratch for Odoo custom add-ons, preferably on Linux.
* It's aimed at those who might be new to Odoo environment setup or want to review potential missed steps.

#### Prerequisites for Odoo Installation
* **Python 3:** Required for Odoo to run. The instructor is using Python 3.10.
* **PostgreSQL:** An instance of PostgreSQL is necessary.
* These can typically be installed using `apt install` on Linux.

#### Cloning Odoo Repositories
* **Odoo Community Edition:** This is the main, free, open-source, and publicly available core repository needed to run Odoo.
    * Clone this repository using `git clone`.
    * For faster cloning without full Git history (if not contributing directly), use `git clone --depth 1 --branch <version>`.
    * If you need the full Git history or want to switch branches, consider using Git worktrees.
    * The example uses version 18.
* **Design Themes:** This repository contains themes for Odoo's website. It's publicly available and free, and recommended for a better visual experience. Clone it using `git clone`.
* **Odoo Enterprise:** This is a private repository, generally accessible to paying customers or partners with an Odoo contract. If you have access, it should also be cloned.

#### Running Odoo with `OdooBin`
* After cloning repositories, it's good practice to organize different Odoo versions in separate directories.
* **Virtual Environment:** Always create and activate a Python virtual environment to manage Odoo's Python packages.
* **Install Requirements:** Navigate into the cloned Odoo directory and install the necessary Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* **Basic Run Command:** Once requirements are installed, run Odoo using `python odoo-bin`. This spins up an Odoo instance, accessible by default at `localhost:8069`.
* **Database Management:**
    * You can create a database via the `localhost:8069/web/database/manager` page.
    * **Preferred Method (`--database` switch):** It's often easier to specify a database directly when running `odoo-bin` using the `-d` or `--database` switch (e.g., `python odoo-bin -d OwlTraining18`). This connects directly to a specific database, bypassing the database manager page and streamlining development.
    * When switching from a community-only setup to including Enterprise, it's recommended to drop and recreate the database or use a new database to ensure all Enterprise modules are loaded correctly.
* **Login:** Default credentials are `admin/admin`.
* **Adding Add-ons Path (`--addons-path`):**
    * This crucial switch tells Odoo where to find modules.
    * You need to provide a comma-separated list of paths to all directories containing modules, including:
        * Odoo's base add-ons (from the Community Edition clone).
        * Enterprise add-ons (if cloned).
        * Design themes (if cloned).
        * Your custom modules directory.
    * **Example:** `python odoo-bin -d <database_name> --addons-path=./addons,../enterprise/addons,../design-themes,../custom_addons`.

#### Creating a Custom Odoo Module
* **Create Custom Add-ons Directory:** Create a new directory (e.g., `custom_addons`) to house your custom modules.
* **Module Structure:** Inside your custom module directory (e.g., `my_module`):
    * Create an empty `__init__.py` file: This marks the directory as a Python package.
    * Create a `__manifest__.py` file: This file defines the module's metadata.
* **`__manifest__.py` Content:**
    * Copy a basic manifest structure from Odoo documentation.
    * **Key fields:** `name`, `version`, `author`, `category`, `description`, `depends` (for module dependencies like 'base'), `data` (for XML files, security, views), `demo` (for demo data).
    * **Module Versioning:** The recommended format is `OdooVersion.ModuleMajor.ModuleMinor.ModulePatch` (e.g., `18.0.1.0.0`).
        * Increment patch for bug fixes.
        * Increment minor for small features.
        * Increment major for breaking changes or significant updates.
        * Update the Odoo version part when upgrading the module for a new Odoo version.
    * **License:** Add a `license` key (e.g., `'LGPL-3'`) to explicitly state the module's license; otherwise, it defaults to LGPL-3.
* **Updating Apps List:** After adding a new custom module directory to `--addons-path`, you need to:
    * **Activate Developer Mode:** If not already active, go to `Settings` > `Developer Tools` and click `Activate Developer Mode`.
    * **Update Apps List:** Go to the Apps menu and click "Update Apps List". This will scan the `addons-path` for new modules.
* **Verify Module:** Search for your module by its `name` from the `__manifest__.py` file. You should now see it listed. You can view its info, including license, technical name, category, and dependencies.
* Activating the module at this stage will not change Odoo's behavior as it's an empty module.
