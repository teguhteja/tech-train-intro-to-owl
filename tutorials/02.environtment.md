#### Setting Up Your Development Environment
* The first step in Odoo development is correctly setting up your environment.
* Familiarity with environment setup from Python technical training is expected.
* This section provides a checklist of necessary items.

#### Supported Odoo Versions
* Odoo officially supports the last three major versions.
* You can check the documentation for currently supported versions.
* As of now, Odoo 18 is the latest, with supported major versions being 16, 17, and 18.

#### Understanding Odoo Branches
* **Master Branch:** This branch contains the latest developments. It is not recommended for basing customizations or for general use due to its instability. This branch is bundled annually to form the next major version.
* **Odoo Online (SaaS):** This is the version used by Odoo's online users and refers to the Software as a Service, multi-tenant system. It's free if used as a single app. If you plan to develop for Odoo Online users, it's best to use this version for development.

#### Essential GitHub Repositories to Clone
* **Design Themes:** This public repository contains Odoo's themes and allows for changing the look and feel of Odoo. It's recommended to have a cloned copy for a better development experience, even if not making changes.
* **Odoo Community Edition:** This is a publicly available, open-source repository. It is free, self-hostable, and includes most necessary features. Cloning this repository is a requirement for Odoo development.
* **Enterprise:** This is a private repository not accessible to everyone. If you are a paying customer or partner and have access, it's beneficial to clone it locally for developing code specific to the Enterprise version.

#### Key Development Tool: OdooBin
* `OdooBin` (or `OdooBinary`) is the primary tool for running Odoo.
* It is located in the root directory of the Odoo Community Edition clone.
* The Odoo documentation's command-line interface section provides details on running Odoo, scaffolding modules, populating databases, and more.
* **Most Important Switch: `--addons-path`**: This switch is crucial for specifying directories where Odoo should look for modules. It's best to include paths to Odoo community add-ons, Enterprise add-ons (if applicable), and your custom modules.
* **Other Useful Switches**:
    * `--init`: Used to initialize modules.
    * `--update`: Used to update modules.
    * `--dev=all`: This switch enables developer features and allows for hot-swapping code, reflecting changes in the running Odoo instance immediately.

#### Other Important Tools: IDE and Browser
* **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** This is where you write your code.
    * Recommended options are Visual Studio Code and PyCharm due to their extensive extensions that can aid Odoo development with features like autocomplete and snippets.
    * You can use any IDE you are comfortable with.
* **Browser:** Essential for viewing the web application you are developing.
    * Google Chrome is often preferred due to its wider range of extensions for Odoo development.
    * Explore extension stores of your chosen IDE and browser for Odoo-related tools to enhance your development process.

### Odoo 17 Tutorial: Setting Up Your Development Environment

**Description:** This tutorial guides you through the essential steps to configure your local development environment for Odoo 17, covering supported versions, required repositories, and key tools.

#### Step 1: Verify Supported Odoo Versions

1.  **Understand Version Support:** Odoo officially supports the last three major versions.
2.  **Target Odoo 17:** Since Odoo 18 is the latest, Odoo 17 is a currently supported major version for development.

#### Step 2: Clone Essential Odoo Repositories

1.  **Clone Odoo Community Edition:**
    * Navigate to Odoo's official GitHub and clone the `odoo/odoo` repository. This is a public, open-source repository that is free to use and self-host.
    * **Requirement:** This repository is mandatory for Odoo development.

2.  **Clone Design Themes:**
    * Clone the `odoo/design-themes` repository from Odoo's GitHub. This public repository contains Odoo's front-end themes.
    * **Recommendation:** While not strictly required for functionality, having this cloned improves the visual appeal of your Odoo instance during development.

3.  **Clone Odoo Enterprise (If Applicable):**
    * If you are an Odoo Enterprise paying customer or partner, you will have access to the private `odoo/enterprise` repository.
    * **Conditional:** Clone this repository if your development involves Odoo Enterprise features or modules.

#### Step 3: Utilize `OdooBin` for Running Odoo

1.  **Locate `OdooBin`:** The `OdooBin` executable is found in the root directory of your cloned Odoo Community Edition repository.
2.  **Configure Add-ons Path (`--addons-path`):**
    * When running Odoo, always use the `--addons-path` switch.
    * Specify a comma-separated list of directories for Odoo to find modules:
        * Path to your Odoo Community add-ons.
        * Path to your Odoo Enterprise add-ons (if applicable).
        * Path to a separate directory where you will house your custom modules.
        * **Example:** `python odoo-bin --addons-path=./addons,../enterprise/addons,../my_custom_modules` (adjust paths as per your setup).
3.  **Enable Developer Features (`--dev=all`):**
    * Include `--dev=all` when starting Odoo to enable hot-swapping of code. This ensures that changes you make to your code are immediately reflected in the running Odoo instance without restarting.
    * **Example:** `python odoo-bin --addons-path=... --dev=all`
4.  **Explore Other `OdooBin` Switches:** Refer to the Odoo documentation's command-line interface section for other useful switches like `--init` (to initialize modules) and `--update` (to update modules).

#### Step 4: Choose Your Development Tools

1.  **Select an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):**
    * **Recommendations:** Visual Studio Code and PyCharm are popular choices due to their extensive extensions that assist with Odoo development, offering features like autocompletion and code snippets.
    * **Flexibility:** You are free to use any IDE you are comfortable with.
2.  **Choose a Web Browser:**
    * **Recommendation:** Google Chrome is often suggested due to the availability of numerous Odoo-related extensions.
    * **Exploration:** Check the extension stores of your chosen IDE and browser for Odoo-specific tools that can enhance your development workflow.
