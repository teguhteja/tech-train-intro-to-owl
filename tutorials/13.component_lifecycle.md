### Extracted Content from `OWL 13 Component Lifecycle`

This tutorial explains the component lifecycle in OWL for Odoo 17, outlining the various stages a component goes through from creation to destruction and the hooks available at each stage.

### Understanding the Component Lifecycle in OWL

Every OWL component experiences a series of lifecycle events from its creation until its destruction. These events are categorized into three main phases: creation, update, and deletion.

#### 1. Creation Lifecycle Events

When an OWL component is created, it goes through the following stages:
* **`setup()`:** This is the first method called when a component is initialized.
* **`onWillStart()`:** This is an asynchronous hook that runs after `setup()` and before the component is rendered. It's useful for fetching initial data.
* **Render:** The component's template is processed and converted into a virtual DOM representation.
* **Mount in DOM:** The component's elements are added to the actual Document Object Model (DOM).
* **`onMounted()`:** This hook is called after the component has been mounted into the DOM. It's suitable for direct DOM manipulation or integrating third-party libraries.

#### 2. Update Lifecycle Events

After a component is created, it can be updated. This often happens when its props or internal state changes. The update cycle includes:
* **`onWillUpdateProps()`:** This hook is called when a component is about to receive new props. It's useful for reacting to prop changes before the component re-renders.
* **Render (Re-render):** The component's template is re-processed to reflect any changes in props or state.
* **`onWillPatch()`:** This asynchronous hook runs after the re-render but before the actual DOM is updated (patched). It's useful for preparing for DOM changes.
* **Update in DOM:** The component's elements in the DOM are updated to reflect the new state. The user will see the changes at this point.
* **`onPatched()`:** This hook is called after the DOM has been updated. It's useful for performing actions immediately after a visual update.

#### 3. Deletion Lifecycle Events

When a component is no longer needed, it is destroyed. The deletion cycle allows for cleanup operations:
* **`onWillUnmount()`:** This hook is called just before the component is unmounted from the DOM. It's useful for cleaning up event listeners or subscriptions.
* **`onWillDestroy()`:** This hook is called just before the component instance is destroyed.
* **Remove from DOM:** The component's elements are removed from the actual DOM. Once this happens, the component's code is no longer in memory, so no further actions can be performed on it.

By understanding these lifecycle hooks, developers can precisely control the behavior of their OWL components at different stages of their existence, ensuring proper initialization, updates, and cleanup.
