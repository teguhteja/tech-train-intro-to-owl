### Extracted Content from `OWL 09 Templates`

#### Introduction to Templates
* This section explores various syntaxes and functionalities of templates in Odoo. 

#### QWeb: Odoo's Templating Engine
* QWeb is Odoo's templating engine, which generates HTML fragments. 
* It is similar to Genshi. 
* QWeb is primarily used within Odoo, but it's a separate project and can be used outside Odoo. 
* Odoo configures QWeb, using `t-` as the default prefix for its directives. 
* Any element starting with `t-` in an XML file is processed by QWeb to generate HTML. 

#### Differences Between OWL and Backend/Website Templates
* QWeb is configured separately for the frontend (OWL templates) and backend. 
* There are differences in QWeb directives used: 
    * `t-foreach`: Used in OWL templates to loop through arrays and requires `t-key`.  In backend versions, it does not require `t-key`. 
    * `t-cache`: Primarily used in backend templates. 
* It's important to distinguish between these template types. 

#### OWL Template Directives (from OWL GitHub Documentation)
* The main documentation for OWL templates is on the official OWL GitHub account under `doc/reference/template.md`. 
* **`t-esc`**: Used to safely output a value by escaping it. 
* **`t-out`**: Outputs a value without escaping it.  (Note: `t-esc` is generally preferred for safety. )
* **`t-set` and `t-value`**: Used to define variables. 
* **Conditionals**: `t-if`, `t-elif`, `t-else`. 
* **Loops**: `t-foreach`. 
* **Dynamic Attributes**: For setting attributes dynamically. 
* **`t-call`**: A QWeb directive used to call other templates (sub-templating). 
* **`t-debug` and `t-log`**: Used for debugging purposes. 
* **Translation Directives**: `t-translation`, `t-translation-context`, and `t-translation-context-prefix` for translation purposes. 
* **`t-component` and `t-props`**: Used in components and when defining sub-components. 
* **`t-ref`**: Allows keeping a reference to an element in the template, which can then be used in JavaScript code to manipulate that element. 
* **`t-key`**: Very important for `t-foreach` loops in OWL, similar to `key` in React. 
* **`t-on` prefix**: Used for event handling (e.g., `t-on:click`).  It hooks onto standard JavaScript events. 
* **`t-slot`**: Will be covered later. 
* The documentation also covers whitespace, expression evaluation, and how QWeb compiles templates. 

#### Hands-on: Template Directives in Action

1.  **`t-esc` vs. `t-out`:**
    * `t-out` was used previously to print a string. 
    * It is generally recommended to use `t-esc` for safety, especially if the string might contain malicious HTML/JavaScript, as `t-esc` escapes the output.  If you are certain the output is safe, `t-out` can be used. 
2.  **Iterating with `t-foreach` in Ordered Lists:**
    * To display an array (e.g., `['Odoo', 'Armin', 'Owl']`) as an ordered list (`<ol> <li>`). 
    * Define a `list` prop of type `Array` in the child component's JavaScript. 
    * Pass the array from the parent component to the child component's `list` prop. 
    * In the child component's XML template, use `t-foreach` on an `<li>` element within an `<ol>` element. 
    * **`t-key` Requirement:** `t-foreach` in OWL *requires* a `t-key` attribute for each iterated item. 
        * Common options for `t-key` include `item.id` (if items have unique IDs) or `item_index` (the special variable provided by `t-foreach` for the current iteration's index). 
        * The `_index` syntax is less commonly known but documented, and represents the current iteration's index. 
        * Other iteration tools include `_first`, `_last`, and `_value` (or `item` in `t-as` syntax). 
    * **Shorthand for `t-out`:** Directives like `t-out` can be used as attributes on HTML tags (e.g., `<li t-out="item">`). This is a shorthand that is more concise and readable than wrapping the content in a separate `<t t-out="...">` element. 

### Odoo 17 Tutorial: Advanced Template Usage with OWL

**Description:** This tutorial explores the capabilities of QWeb, Odoo's templating engine, focusing on advanced directives for OWL components in Odoo 17, including conditional rendering, loops, and dynamic attributes.

#### Step 1: Understand QWeb and OWL Template Differences

1.  **QWeb Basics:** Recognize that QWeb is Odoo's templating engine that processes XML templates to generate HTML fragments. Directives prefixed with `t-` are processed by QWeb. 
2.  **OWL vs. Backend Templates:** Be aware that OWL templates (frontend) have slightly different directive behaviors and requirements compared to traditional Odoo backend templates. Notably, `t-foreach` in OWL requires a `t-key`. 
3.  **Refer to OWL Documentation:** For comprehensive details on OWL-specific template directives, consult the official OWL GitHub repository's `doc/reference/template.md` file. 

#### Step 2: Utilize `t-esc` for Safe Output

1.  **Review `t-out` vs. `t-esc`:** While `t-out` directly outputs a value, `t-esc` escapes it, preventing potential security vulnerabilities (like XSS) if the value contains HTML or JavaScript. 
2.  **Update Child Component Template:** In your `my_module/static/src/child_component/child_component.xml` file, change `t-out` to `t-esc` for your `title` prop to ensure safe rendering:
    ```xml
    <t t-name="my_module.child_component">
        <div>
            <h3>Child Component: <t t-esc="props.title"/></h3>
        </div>
    </t>
    ```
    * Although the current string is safe, using `t-esc` is a best practice. 

#### Step 3: Implement `t-foreach` for List Rendering

1.  **Define a List Prop in Child Component:**
    * In your `my_module/static/src/child_component/child_component.js`, add a new `list` prop of type `Array`:
        ```javascript
        import { Component } from "@odoo/owl";

        export class ChildComponent extends Component {
            static template = "my_module.child_component";
            static props = {
                title: String,
                list: Array, // New: expects an array prop
            };
        }
        ``` 
2.  **Pass List from Parent Component:**
    * In your parent component's template (`my_module/static/src/xml/example_component.xml`), pass an array to the `list` prop of your `ChildComponent`. Remember to enclose the array in single quotes to pass it as a JavaScript expression:
        ```xml
        <ChildComponent title="'This is from the Parent!'" list="['Odoo', 'Armin', 'OWL']"/>
        ``` 
3.  **Iterate in Child Component Template:**
    * In `my_module/static/src/child_component/child_component.xml`, use `t-foreach` to loop through the `props.list` and display each item in an ordered list.
    * **Crucially, include `t-key`**: When using `t-foreach` in OWL, you must provide a `t-key` attribute to uniquely identify each item in the loop. The `_index` variable is available within `t-foreach` for this purpose. 
    * Use the shorthand `t-esc` attribute directly on the `<li>` tag for concise code. 
        ```xml
        <t t-name="my_module.child_component">
            <div>
                <h3>Child Component: <t t-esc="props.title"/></h3>
                <h4>My List:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <t t-foreach="props.list" t-as="item" t-key="item_index">
                        <li t-esc="item"/>
                    </t>
                </ol>
            </div>
        </t>
        ``` 

#### Step 4: Restart Odoo Server and Verify

1.  **Restart Odoo:** Ensure your Odoo instance is restarted with your module updated (e.g., `python odoo-bin -d YourDatabase -u my_module --addons-path=... --dev=all`).
2.  **Check in Browser:** Navigate to the Odoo backend view where your parent component is displayed. You should now see:
    * The title from the parent component.
    * An ordered list containing "Odoo", "Armin", and "OWL" rendered by the child component using `t-foreach`. 

This confirms successful implementation of `t-esc` and `t-foreach` directives in your OWL templates.
