### Extracted Content from `OWL 03 Assets & Bundles`

#### Introduction to Assets and Bundles
* This section explains how Odoo serves files to the front-end as assets and bundles.

#### Types of Static Assets
* **JavaScript files:** These typically contain the main logic for the front-end.
* **CSS files:** Primarily control the visual appearance of elements.
* **XML templates:** Used to display information to users.
* **Fonts and Images:** Their functions are self-explanatory.

#### Housing Static Assets
* All static assets in Odoo are located within the `static` directory at the root of an Odoo module.
* For instance, in the `website_sales_stock` module, a `static` directory exists.
* Inside the `static` directory, you'll often find:
    * `source` directory: Contains the main code, including JavaScript files and XML templates.
    * `tests` directory: Houses tests.
    * `description` directory: If an `icon.png` or `icon.svg` is placed here, it will be displayed as the module's icon in the Odoo apps list, replacing a placeholder.

#### Assets in Odoo Documentation
* The official Odoo documentation provides details on static assets.
* You can find this information under `Reference` > `Server Framework` > `Module Manifests` > `Assets`.
* The definition of assets describes how all static files are loaded into various asset bundles.

#### Understanding Bundles
* **Purpose of Bundles:** When Odoo sends files (like JavaScript and CSS) to the front-end, it bundles them into different sections or "packs".
* **Reason for Bundling:** Odoo has multiple sections (e.g., backend, website, specific apps), and not all files are needed in every section. Bundling prevents unnecessary files from being loaded, improving performance.
* **Defining Bundles in Manifests:** The `__manifest__.py` file of a module includes an `assets` key, allowing you to define which files go into which bundle.
* **Commonly Used Bundles:**
    * `web.assets_backend`: For the backend used by internal users.
    * `web.assets_frontend`: For the public website.
    * Bundles for tests.
    * `web.assets_common`: Contains low-level building blocks of Odoo, which developers typically don't add files to.
* **Custom Bundles:** You can define your own bundles, but files must be placed in the correct bundle to be sent to the front-end appropriately.

#### Advanced Bundling Syntax
* Odoo offers advanced syntax for controlling the loading order of assets.
* **`before` syntax:** Allows an asset to be loaded before a specified existing asset. This is useful for defining hierarchies where one code requires another to be loaded first.
* Other operations, such as `remove` (e.g., `remove the first`, `remove the previous code`), can be used to manage asset conflicts.
* The Odoo documentation under `Web Framework` > `Assets` provides a detailed overview of bundles and operations.

#### Dynamic Assets (`ir.asset`)
* `ir.asset` is a representation of your asset in the Odoo database and has its own model, similar to `sale.order` or `account.move`.
* This model has various functionalities, but direct manipulation is usually not required for front-end development.
* It serves as a last resort or debugging tool to investigate issues.

### Odoo 17 Tutorial: Managing Front-End Assets and Bundles

**Description:** This tutorial will guide you through understanding how Odoo 17 serves front-end files using assets and bundles, and how to manage them effectively for your custom modules.

#### Step 1: Understand Static Assets in Odoo 17

1.  **Identify Asset Types:** Familiarize yourself with the common static asset types used in Odoo 17 development:
    * JavaScript files (for logic).
    * CSS files (for styling).
    * XML templates (for rendering UI).
    * Images and fonts.
2.  **Locate Assets:** Remember that all static assets for your module must reside within a `static` directory at the root of your Odoo module.
    * Organize your JavaScript and XML files typically within a `source` subdirectory inside `static`.
    * Consider adding an `icon.png` or `icon.svg` in a `static/description` folder to provide a custom icon for your module in the Odoo apps list.

#### Step 2: Grasp the Concept of Asset Bundles

1.  **Purpose of Bundling:** Understand that Odoo bundles assets (JavaScript, CSS, etc.) into "packs" to optimize loading. This prevents unnecessary files from being loaded across different Odoo sections (like the backend vs. the website), improving performance.
2.  **Declare Assets in `__manifest__.py`:**
    * The `assets` key in your module's `__manifest__.py` file is where you define which static files belong to which bundle.
    * **Common Bundles:**
        * `web.assets_backend`: Use this bundle for assets required by the Odoo backend (internal users' interface).
        * `web.assets_frontend`: Use this bundle for assets needed on the public-facing Odoo website.
        * `web.assets_common`: Generally, you won't add your custom files here as it contains Odoo's core building blocks.
    * You can include all files from a directory using a wildcard (`*`).

#### Step 3: Control Asset Loading Order with Advanced Syntax

1.  **Prioritize Asset Loading:** Utilize Odoo's advanced bundling syntax to control when your assets load relative to others.
    * **`before` operator:** To ensure your asset loads before a specific existing asset, use the `before` attribute in your asset definition. This is crucial for managing dependencies where your code relies on another asset being present first.
    * **`remove` operator:** If your code conflicts with an existing asset, you can use `remove` (e.g., `remove the first`, `remove the previous code`) to eliminate the conflicting asset before adding your own.
2.  **Consult Documentation:** For a comprehensive list of bundles and operations, refer to the official Odoo documentation under the `Web Framework` > `Assets` section.

#### Step 4: Briefly Understand Dynamic Assets (`ir.asset`)

1.  **Database Representation:** Be aware that assets have a dynamic representation in the Odoo database as `ir.asset` records.
2.  **Limited Direct Interaction:** For typical front-end development, you generally won't need to interact directly with the `ir.asset` model.
3.  **Debugging Tool:** This model primarily serves as a debugging tool or a last resort for troubleshooting complex asset-related issues.
